# spring-boot-jdbc-vs-r2dbc

This repository contains the code to be able to test the different performances between a spring-boot blocking application based on JDBC 
and a spring web-flux application wich uses R2DBC reactive drivers.

The experimental results I've found have been published in the following medium article for you to consider.

```

### Step 2:

Run k6 tests in temporary container by executing the following command inside the "k6-testing" folder:

```shell
docker-compose run --rm k6 run /k6-scripts/<test-name> -e TYPE=jdbc -e USERS=20
```

Before each test you should run the following script to make every load test independent of the previous executions.

```sql
delete from books b where b.book_id <> 1;
delete from orders ;
```

### Step 3:

Datas will be available on the grafana dashboard at:
